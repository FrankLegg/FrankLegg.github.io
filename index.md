### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 1 was a favorite because I enjoyed learning how to convert measurements from milliliters to different units like teaspoons, tablespoons, ounces, and cups. It was exciting to write functions that handled these conversions accurately. This project helped me understand how to use variables and functions in C++ effectively. Plus, seeing the final output with all the correct conversions was really satisfying. 
* Lab 7
    Lab 7, part 1 was also a favorite because it tackled a real-world problem I've often wondered about â€“ how street parking restrictions work. Writing functions to determine whether parking is allowed based on posted signs was a great way to apply conditional logic and time validation. I enjoyed figuring out how to validate the input correctly and handle different parking rules for various streets. This lab helped me improve my programming skills and understand the practical applications of coding in everyday situations. 
* Lab 8
    Lab 8, part 2 was a favorite because I loved creating a visual pattern using code. It was fascinating to see how loops can be used to generate such intricate designs. Writing the code to print the pattern with dashes, bars, and asterisks was both challenging and rewarding. This lab helped me understand the power of loops in programming and how small changes in the code can create different patterns. It was fun experimenting with different loop structures to get the desired output.
